Player features:
- Uses rolling buffer which loads 300 frames at a time; buffer updated at the end of each 300-frame window; might cause lag
- Hard-sync at the end of each 300-frame window

Scene split:
- Uses scenedetect package

Ad scene detection tests:
- Short scenes tend to be ads
- Loud scenes tend to be ads
- Spectral Entropy test by first converting to FFT space and then calculating histogram entropy; low entropy (low noise) scenes tend to be ads

Bounding box:
- Match extracted Orb features from logo image and frame
- Lowe's ratio test to identify good matches
- If enough good matches, compute homography on logo image's square to generate bounding box

My contributions:
- wrote the player
- spectral entropy test for ad scene detection
- memory optimization for bounding box
- research ideas in general (I suggested using orb feature matching)
